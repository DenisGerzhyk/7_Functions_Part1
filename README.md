# 7_Functions_Part1
1).
The first code block uses the Counter function from the collections module to count the occurrences of each element in the nums list. Then, it finds the minimum number based on the counts using the min() function and the get() method of the num_counts dictionary.

2).
The second code block takes a list of integers number and creates a new list number_new that contains the digits of the result of adding one to the integer represented by the number list. It does this by first converting the list of integers to a single integer using join() and then adding one to that integer. It then converts the resulting integer back to a list of digits using a loop that repeatedly extracts the last digit of the integer using modulo arithmetic and integer division.

3).
The third code block defines a function string_func that takes a string argument string_new and returns True if the string is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards), and False otherwise. It does this by first converting the string to lowercase using the lower() method, removing punctuation using the translate() method and the str.maketrans() function, and removing spaces using the replace() method. It then checks if the resulting string is equal to its reverse using the [::-1] slice notation.
